# trace-a-ray

This repository captures my work while learning to implement a fully
tested ray-tracer. I'm attempting to do this in Clojure so that I can
learn the language. I am following along with the principles set forth
in [The Ray Tracer Challenge by Jamis
Buck](https://pragprog.com/book/jbtracer/the-ray-tracer-challenge).

## Installation

Clone the repository.

## Usage

Execute the following with nix installed and flakes enabled,

    $ nix run

or

    $ nix develop
    $ clojure -M -m trace-a-ray.core

## Options

Currently there are no options.

## Development

The development environment builds with Nix and notably
[clj-nix](https://github.com/jlesquembre/clj-nix). I used a pinned
version of clj-nix below so that the lockfile will get generated
consistently. I found the hash using `nix flake info github:jlesquembre/clj-nix`

### Connecting to nrepl

To connect to nRepl you need to log into the nix develop shell and launch the server

```shell
nix develop
clj -M:cider-clj
```

### Updating Maven dependencies

    $ nix run github:jlesquembre/clj-nix/7d9e244ea96988524ba3bd6c2bbafdf0a5340b96#deps-lock
    $ nix build


## Testing

To run tests enter the nix shell with `nix develop` then execute `clj -X:test`

## Profiling

```clojure
clj -J-Djdk.attach.allowAttachSelf
(require '[trace-a-ray.core])
(require '[clj-async-profiler.core :as prof])
(prof/profile (trace-a-ray.core/-main))
(prof/serve-ui 8080)
```

## Examples

### Sphere projection
![2d projection](/doc/images/sphere.png)

The 2d projection above is a demonstration that a sphere in 3d
worldspace and be projected onto a plane.

### Performance

Performance is an ongoing consideration. Step one is to make the
implementations correct. Step two is to find optimal ways of
generating the scenes.

If you want to isolate a function use something like the following on
the REPL. Update the implementation of the `intersect` function and
measure again.

```clojure
(comment
  (require '[trace-a-ray.ray :as ray ] :reload)
  (require '[trace-a-ray.sphere :as sphere] :reload)
  (require '[trace-a-ray.ray :as ray ] :reload)
  (require '[trace-a-ray.tuple :as tuple] :reload)
  (time (dotimes [_ 100000]
          (let [s   (sphere/make-sphere)
                p   (tuple/point 0 0 -5)
                dir (tuple/vector 0 0 1)
                r   (ray/make-ray p dir)]
            (ray/intersect s r)))))
```

### Generating examples

1. Install netpbm
2. Execute the following
   `$ pnmtopng <file>.ppm > <file>.png`
