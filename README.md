# trace-a-ray

This repository captures my work while learning to implement a fully
tested ray-tracer. I'm attempting to do this in Clojure so that I can
learn the language. I am following along with the principles set forth
in [The Ray Tracer Challenge by Jamis
Buck](https://pragprog.com/book/jbtracer/the-ray-tracer-challenge).

## Installation

Clone the repository.

## Usage

Execute the following,

    $ lein run

## Options

Currently there are no options.

## Examples

### Sphere projection
![2d projection](/doc/images/sphere.png)

The 2d projection above is a demonstration that a sphere in 3d
worldspace and be projected onto a plane.

### Performance

Performance is an ongoing consideration. Step one is to make the
implementations correct. Step two is to find optimal ways of
generating the scenes.

### Generating examples

1. Install netpbm
2. Execute the following
   `$ pnmtopng <file>.ppm > <file>.png`
